# 🧠🎙️ AI Voice Chatbot

An intelligent AI-powered chatbot that communicates with users via **voice input and output**, combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) with speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities. This project allows users to talk to the chatbot and hear it respond—hands-free and natural.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔊 **Voice Input:** Users can speak to the chatbot using their microphone.
- 🗣️ **Voice Output:** The chatbot responds with synthesized speech.
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Conversations:** Uses a language model (e.g., GPT or similar) for intelligent responses.
- 🖥️ **Text Interface Option:** Also supports typed input and output for accessibility.
- 🌐 **Cross-platform:** Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux with Python support.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- `speech_recognition` – For voice input (converts speech to text)
- `pyttsx3` – For voice output (text-to-speech)
- `groq` - For calling Llama API
